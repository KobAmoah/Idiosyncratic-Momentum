# Idiosyncratic-Momentum
  This tutorial develops a strategy based on the idiosyncratic price momentum effect of stocks. It is designed to be run on the QuantConnect Platform. The strategy is derived from the paper "Eureka! A Momentum Strategy that Also Works in Japan" by Denis B. Chaves. [Link to Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1982100) Idiosyncratic momentum – an alternative definition of momentum – calculates the idiosyncratic returns from market regressions. A report is attached that details the performance of this view of momentum.
  
  Chaves (2012) suggests momentum can be made less volatile by removing the return component due to market beta exposure. To enable this comparison, an implementation of pure price momentum is provided.
 
* This work was initially done for the Finance 485 Course at Lake Forest College

## Credits
I am incredibly grateful to my collaborators Rebecca Stoia, and Yamaris Finnigan. They contributed immensely to documenting the strategy in the form of a report.

# Using the Code
The code maintained here is designed to show an implementation of a price-based momentum strategy on QuantConnect. You do not need to contact me nor my collaborators unless you're reproducing a significant portion of the code. Incorporating a significant amount of the code into your product's documentation does require documentation.
